# Project Management App

This is was an app I made for practice with React and web development based on "Section 9: Practice Project: Project Management App (with Components, State, Refs & More)" from [this tutorial](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-course-resources). It let's you create and delete projects and tasks. It is a helpful reference for how to use React components for modals and sidebars, passing React state down through nested components, refs/forwardRef, createPortal from react-dom, and Tailwind CSS.

## Run the Project

1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run the project with `npm run dev`
